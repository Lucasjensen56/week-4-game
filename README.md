# week-4-game

##About this Project 
In this project I worked to create a game that randomly generates a number and the user has to attempt to match 4 hidden numbers 
to this number-if the number matches the randomly generated number they win, if it goes over they lose. See the main steps below:

*Randomly number is generated
*Four pictures (in this case potions) have a hidden value associated with them
*The Player will click on each picture to generate a score
*If this score matches the randomly number generated, the player wins. If the number is greater than the random number the player loses
*The app shows the total wins and loses
*After the player wins or loses, all the number are randomized 
*The player can see how many times they can win
